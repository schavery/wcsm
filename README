If you ever put together a website from scratch, you know that the process goes something like this:
Add an element, add some styles, save and reload the browser. That's basically the loop, and we refine the design of the site over time.

An interesting aspect of this development strategy is that the website evolves, in a sense. It starts as a completely blank slate, and new features appear, move around, and get settled in their own way.

This inspired me to create a tool to capture this progression, so that these changes could be rendered as a stop motion video or gif.

The python file is currently ready to use. It contains usage instructions on the command line interface.
